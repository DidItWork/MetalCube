Hello!

Welcome to the github page of the open source Metal Cube project! This 
is meant to be a stepping stone for me into machine design, so feel free 
to make any comments on the design (it is definitely not close to 
perfect).

The printer is built with rigidity and reliability in mind, routine 
adjustments should be kept at a minimum and the print quality should be 
repeatable. As such, the following techniques were employed: 

1) Use of off-the-shelf metal components to form the structure of the 
machine, linear bearings are fitted into the groves of aluminium 
extrusions to provide better rigidity and clamps are made of 
interlocking screws.

2) Reduction of parts, with reduced part counts, assembly inaccuracies will be less in the way of print quality

3) As this is still a Reprap printer, 3d printed parts are unavoidable, they are usually more for alignment purposes or are reinforced with metal screws. Load-bearing structural components like some parts of the printhead are made in one solid piece to improve rigidity.

That's about all for MC V1, I hope you enjoy this project and maybe even give it a try to build this machine!
